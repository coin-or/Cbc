/** FathomDynamicProgramming class.

    The idea is that after some branching the problem will be effectively smaller than
    the original problem and maybe there will be a more specialized technique which can completely
    fathom this branch quickly.

    This is a dynamic programming implementation which is very fast for some 
    specialized problems.  It expects small integral rhs, an all integer problem
    and positive integral coefficients. At present it can not do general set covering
    problems just set partitioning.  It can find multiple optima for various rhs 
    combinations.
    
    The main limiting factor is size of state space.  Each 1 rhs doubles the size of the problem.
    2 or 3 rhs quadruples, 4,5,6,7 by 8 etc.
