/** \brief Abstract branching object base class
    Now just difference with OsiBranchingObject

  In the abstract, an CbcBranchingObject contains instructions for how to
  branch. We want an abstract class so that we can describe how to branch on
  simple objects (<i>e.g.</i>, integers) and more exotic objects
  (<i>e.g.</i>, cliques or hyperplanes).

  The #branch() method is the crucial routine: it is expected to be able to
  step through a set of branch arms, executing the actions required to create
  each subproblem in turn. The base class is primarily virtual to allow for
  a wide range of problem modifications.

  See CbcObject for an overview of the three classes (CbcObject,
  CbcBranchingObject, and CbcBranchDecision) which make up cbc's branching
  model.
