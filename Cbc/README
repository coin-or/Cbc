WHAT'S NEW
==========

Release 2.8:

1. Introduced new secondaryStatus 8 to indicate that solving stopped due to an iteration limit.

2. Solution pool is now accessible via the command line and the CbcMain* interface.

3. New mipstart option to read an initial feasible solution from a file. Only values for discrete
   variables need to be provided.

4. Added Proximity Search heuristic by Fischetti and Monaci (off by default):
   The simplest way to switch it on using stand-alone version is "-proximity on".

   Proximity Search is the new "No-Neighborhood Search" 0-1 MIP refinement heuristic recently proposed by 
   Fischetti and Monaci (2012). The idea is to define a sub-MIP without additional constraints but with a 
   modified objective function intended to attract the search in the proximity of the incumbent. The approach 
   works well for 0-1 MIPs whose solution landscape is not too irregular (meaning the there is reasonable 
   probability of finding an improved solution by flipping a small number of binary variables), in particular 
   when it is applied to the first heuristic solutions found at the root node.

Release 2.7.8:
   Look at https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc/changeset?old_path=%2Freleases%2F2.7.7&new_path=%2Freleases%2F2.7.8 to see all changes.

1. Change message when LP simplex iteration limit is hit from "Exiting on maximum nodes"
   to "Exiting on maximum number of iterations"

2. Fix for using overlapping SOS.

3. Fixes in buildsystem.

1. Fix to report interruption on user event if SIGINT is received by CbcSolver.
   model->status() should now be 5 if this event happened.
   Added method CbcModel::sayEventHappened() to make cbc stop due to an 'user event'.

2. Other minor fixes.

1. Allow row/column names for GMPL models.

2. Added CbcModel::haveMultiThreadSupport() to indicate whether Cbc library has been compiled with multithread support.

3. Added CbcModel::waitingForMiniBranchAndBound() to indicate whether sub-MIP heuristic is currently running.

4. Cbc shell should work with readline if configured with --enable-gnu-packages.

5. Support for compressed input files (.gz, .bz2) is now enabled by default.
