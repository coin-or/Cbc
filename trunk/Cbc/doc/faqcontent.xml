  What can the community do to help?
  </para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>
  People from all around the world are already helping.  There are
  probably ten people who do not always post to the discussion mail list but are constantly
  "improving" the code by demanding performance or bug fixes or enhancements.  And there
  are others posting questions to discussion groups. (JF 04/01/05) 
  </para>
  <para>
  A good start is to join the coin-discuss
