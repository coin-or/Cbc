/** Define a follow on class.
    The idea of this is that in air-crew scheduling problems crew may fly in on flight A
    and out on flight B or on some other flight.  A useful branch is one which on one side
    fixes all which go out on flight B to 0, while the other branch fixes all those that do NOT
    go out on flight B to 0.

    This tries to generalize so that cuts are produced with sum aij xj <= bi on each side. 
    It should be intelligent enough to fix if things can be fixed.
    We also need to make sure branch cuts work properly (i.e. persistence).

    This branching rule should be in addition to normal rules and have a high priority.
