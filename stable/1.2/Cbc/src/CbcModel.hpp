/** Simple Branch and bound class

  The initialSolve() method solves the initial LP relaxation of the MIP
  problem. The branchAndBound() method can then be called to finish using
  a branch and cut algorithm.

  <h3>Search Tree Traversal</h3>

  Subproblems (aka nodes) requiring additional evaluation are stored using
  the CbcNode and CbcNodeInfo objects. Ancestry linkage is maintained in the
  CbcNodeInfo object. Evaluation of a subproblem within branchAndBound()
  proceeds as follows:
  <ul>
    <li> The node representing the most promising parent subproblem is popped
	 from the heap which holds the set of subproblems requiring further
	 evaluation.
    <li> Using branching instructions stored in the node, and information in
	 its ancestors, the model and solver are adjusted to create the
	 active subproblem.
    <li> If the parent subproblem will require further evaluation
	 (<i>i.e.</i>, there are branches remaining) its node is pushed back
	 on the heap. Otherwise, the node is deleted.  This may trigger
	 recursive deletion of ancestors.
    <li> The newly created subproblem is evaluated.
    <li> If the subproblem requires further evaluation, a node is created.
	 All information needed to recreate the subproblem (branching
	 information, row and column cuts) is placed in the node and the node
	 is added to the set of subproblems awaiting further evaluation.
  </ul>
  Note that there is never a node representing the active subproblem; the model
  and solver represent the active subproblem.

  <h3>Row (Constraint) Cut Handling</h3>

  For a typical subproblem, the sequence of events is as follows:
  <ul>
    <li> The subproblem is rebuilt for further evaluation: One result of a
	 call to addCuts() is a traversal of ancestors, leaving a list of all
	 cuts used in the ancestors in #addedCuts_. This list is then scanned
	 to construct a basis that includes only tight cuts. Entries for
	 loose cuts are set to NULL.
    <li> The subproblem is evaluated: One result of a call to solveWithCuts()
         is the return of a set of newly generated cuts for the subproblem.
	 #addedCuts_ is also kept up-to-date as old cuts become loose.
    <li> The subproblem is stored for further processing: A call to
	 CbcNodeInfo::addCuts() adds the newly generated cuts to the
	 CbcNodeInfo object associated with this node.
  </ul>
  See CbcCountRowCut for details of the bookkeeping associated with cut
  management.
