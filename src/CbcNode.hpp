/** Information required while the node is live

  When a subproblem is initially created, it is represented by an CbcNode
  object and an attached CbcNodeInfo object.

  The CbcNode contains information (depth, branching instructions), that's
  needed while the subproblem remains `live', <i>i.e.</i>, while the
  subproblem is not fathomed and there are branch arms still be be
  evaluated.  The CbcNode is deleted when the last branch arm has been
  evaluated.

  The CbcNodeInfo object contains the information needed to maintain the
  search tree and recreate the subproblem for the node. It remains in
  existence until there are no nodes remaining in the subtree rooted at this
  node.
