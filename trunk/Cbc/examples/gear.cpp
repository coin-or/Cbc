This shows how we can define a new branching method to solve problems with
nonlinearities and discontinuities.

We are going to solve the problem

minimize  abs  ( 1.0/6.931 - x1*x4/x2*x3)

where the variables are integral between 12 and 60.
See E.Sangren, "Nonlinear Integer and Discrete Programming in 
Mechanical Design Optimization". Trans. ASME, J. Mech Design 112, 223-229, 1990

One could try to use logarithms to make the problem separable but that leads to a 
weak formulation.  Instaed we are going to use linked
special ordered sets.  The generalization with column generation can be even more powerful
but is not yet in CBC.

The idea is simple:

A linear variable is a convex combination of its lower bound and upper bound!
If x must lie between 12 and 60 then we can substitute for x  as x == 12.0*xl + 60.0*xu where
xl + xu == 1.0.  At first this looks cumbersome but if we have xl12, xl13, ... xl60 and corresponding
xu and yl and yu then we can write:

x == sum 12.0*xl[i] + 60.0* xu[i] where sum xl[i] + xu[i] == 1.0
and 
x*y == 12.0*12.0*xl12 + 12.0*60.0*xu12 + 13.0*12.0*xl13 + 13.0*60.0*x13 ....
                 + 12.0*60*.0xl60 + 60.0*60.0*xu60

And now x*y is correct if x is integer and xl[i], xu[i] are only nonzero for one i.
Note that this would have worked just as easily for y**2 or any clean function of y.

So this is just like a special ordered set of type 1 but on two sets simultaneously.
The idea is even more powerful if we want other functions on y as we can branch on all
sets simultaneously.
Also note that convexity requirements for any non-linear functions are not needed.

So we need a new branching method to do that - see CbcBranchLink.?pp

We are going to need a CbcBranchLink method to see whether we are satisfied etc and also to
create another branching object which knows how to fix variables.  We might be able to use an
existing method for the latter but let us create two methods CbcLink and 
CbcLinkBranchingObject.

For CbcLink we will need the following methods:
Constructot/Destructor
infeasibility - returns 0.0 if feasible otherwise some measure of infeasibility
feasibleRegion - sets bounds to contain current solution
createBranch - creates a CbcLinkBranchingObject

For CbcLinkBranchingObject we need:
Constructor/Destructor
branch - does actual fixing
print - optional for debug purposes.

The easiest way to do this is to cut and paste from CbcBranchActual to get current
SOS stuff and then modify that.
