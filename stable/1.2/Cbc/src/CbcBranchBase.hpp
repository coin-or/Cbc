/** Abstract base class for `objects'.

  The branching model used in Cbc is based on the idea of an <i>object</i>.
  In the abstract, an object is something that has a feasible region, can be
  evaluated for infeasibility, can be branched on (<i>i.e.</i>, there's some
  constructive action to be taken to move toward feasibility), and allows
  comparison of the effect of branching.

  This class (CbcObject) is the base class for an object. To round out the
  branching model, the class CbcBranchingObject describes how to perform a
  branch, and the class CbcBranchDecision describes how to compare two
  CbcBranchingObjects.

  To create a new type of object you need to provide three methods:
  #infeasibility(), #feasibleRegion(), and #createBranch(), described below.

  This base class is primarily virtual to allow for any form of structure.
  Any form of discontinuity is allowed.

  \todo The notion that all branches are binary (two arms) is wired into the
	implementation of CbcObject, CbcBranchingObject, and
	CbcBranchDecision. Changing this will require a moderate amount of
	recoding.

  each subproblem in turn. The base class is primarily virtual to allow for
