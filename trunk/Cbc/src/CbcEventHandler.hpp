    \brief Event handling for cbc

  This file contains the declaration of CbcEventHandler, used for event
  handling in cbc.

  The central method is CbcEventHandler::event(). The default semantics of
  this call are `ask for the action to take in reponse to this event'. The
  call is made at the point in the code where the event occurs (<i>e.g.</i>,
  when a solution is found, or when a node is added to or removed from the
  search tree). The return value specifies the action to perform in response
  to the event (<i>e.g.</i>, continue, or stop).

  This is a lazy class. Initially, it knows nothing about specific events,
  and returns dfltAction_ for any event. This makes for a trivial constructor
  and fast startup. The only place where the list of known events or actions
  is hardwired is in the enum definitions for CbcEvent and CbcAction,
  respectively.

  At the first call to setAction, a map is created to hold (Event,Action)
  pairs, and this map will be consulted ever after. Events not in the map
  will still return the default value.

  For serious extensions, derive a subclass and replace event() with a
  function that suits you better.  The function has access to the CbcModel
  via a pointer held in the CbcEventHandler object, and can do as much
  thinking as it likes before returning an answer.  You can also print as
  much information as you want. The model is held as a const, however, so
  you can't alter reality.

  The design of the class deliberately matches ClpEventHandler, so that other
  solvers can participate in cbc without breaking the patterns set by
  clp-specific code.

/*! \class CbcEventHandler
    \brief Base class for Cbc event handling.

  Up front: We're not talking about unanticipated events here. We're talking
  about anticipated events, in the sense that the code is going to make a call
  to event() and is prepared to obey the return value that it receives.

  The general pattern for usage is as follows:
  <ol>
    <li> Create a CbcEventHandler object. This will be initialised with a set
	 of default actions for every recognised event.

    <li> Attach the event handler to the CbcModel object.

    <li> When execution reaches the point where an event occurs, call the
	 event handler as CbcEventHandler::event(the event). The return value
	 will specify what the code should do in response to the event.
  </ol>

  The return value associated with an event can be changed at any time.
